IN GCP :

VPC - global  - NO CIDR
subnets - regional - CIDR  for each subnet

there is no private and public subnets, while creating Vms we need to disable external Ip s




In AWS :

VPC - regional  - CIDR range 
subnets - AZ s  - with in vpc CIDR range 

by default private subnet , need to add IG for internet access and make it public



in aws network flow :



          ---   private subnet -- NAT in (public subnet )  - Privte Route table ( Via NAT) and local route 
VPC ----
          ---   Public subnet  -- Ineternet Gateway - Public Route table ( Via IGW) and local route 



Address ranges to be use by private networks are:

Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
